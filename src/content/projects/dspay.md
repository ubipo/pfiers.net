DSpay is my high-school thesis on a digital payment system at school. I studied
the existing system and possible alternatives, set requirements for a new
system, and conducted research through interviews and surveys. I then designed
and implemented a functional prototype with a [Node.js](/technologies/node-js) + 
[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) web server/interface and an
[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266)-based demo payment
terminal programmed in [C++](/technologies/cpp).

Though this system was never adopted, the thesis did received a grade of 90%.
