[Open Summer of Code](https://osoc.be/) is a 4-week summer programme focused on
building open source projects of public utility.

Commissioned by [Brussels Mobility](https://mobilite-mobiliteit.brussels), my
team and I built [Cyclofix](https://cyclofix.osm.be/map/): a web app to find and
update information on cycling infrastructure on
[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about).

Because of its success [Pieter Vander Vennet](https://github.com/pietervdvn) –
one of the team members – continued working on a generalized version of the app
known as [MapComplete](https://pietervdvn.github.io/MapComplete/), which is now
used to map [everything](https://mapcomplete.osm.be/) from [AED
locations](https://mapcomplete.osm.be/aed.html) to [rainbow pedestrian
crossings](https://mapcomplete.osm.be/rainbow_crossings.html).
