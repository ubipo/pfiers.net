          </h3>
          <p class="occupation-details">March 2023 - present</p>
          <p>
            As a Data & Cloud Engineer at Dataroots, I collaborate with
            customers from all sectors to create truly end-to-end data
            solutions. This includes not just crafting state-of-the-art models
            and analysis platforms, but also building a long term data strategy
            and setting up the cloud infrastructure to support it all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Joining a team of five, I started my first project at dataroots in
            April of 2023. Our client,
            <a href="https://cluepoints.com/">CluePoints</a>, offers a risk and
            quality management platform for clinical trials, used among others
            by <a href="https://www.pfizer.com/">Pfizer</a> and the <a
            href="https://www.fda.gov/">FDA</a>. The goal of our team was to
            eliminate bottlenecks and increase flexibility in the trial data
            ingestion pipeline. To this end I deployed and benchmarked multiple
            datalake components including the Airflow and Prefect workflow
            orchestrators, databricks and snowflake data intelligence platforms,
            and a combination of dbt, Spark, and custom Python data pipelines.
            We were able to reduce the storage requirements by an order of
            magnitude and to greatly increase the speed and flexibility of trial
            data transformations.
          </p>
          <p>
            On my second and current project, I am collaborating with the
            audience data intelligence team of <a
            href="https://www.vrt.be/">VRT</a>, the dutch-language public
            broadcaster of Belgium. The goal of this project is to integrate
            viewership and engagement data from multiple sources into the
            company-wide datalake. To best support the existing workflows of the
            team, I have developed an Airflow-orchestrated data export task
            server for Windows Server. This <a
            href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a> Python server uses
            a combination of accessibility automation frameworks and UI machine
            vision systems to extract data from GUI-only applications. My
            solution eliminates the need for repetitive manual report generation
            and allows the creation of rich new dashboards and analyses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also advised, and helped my teammates in various projects, for
            among others, C-Energy, Touring, and Immoscoop. I did this in
            particularly through my expertise in machine vision as well as
            infrastructure and system administration.

          </h3>
          <p>
            For my <a href="https://pfiers.net/dissertation.pdf">Master’s
            thesis</a>, I developed the high-level planning software for <i><a
            href="https://pfiers.net/projects/lakehopper">Lakehopper</a></i>, an
            autonomous drone that can fly indefinitely by hopping from one lake
            to the next, recharging its batteries each time using solar panels.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system uses a custom designed deep convolutional neural network
            that I trained to identify lakes and buildings in aerial imagery. It
            further uses <a href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a> for object
            detection based on this data. From this, it generates a navigation
            graph to calculate the best multi-hop paths between lakes. These
            paths avoid build-up areas and restricted airspace.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time I have created a first prototype version of the
            drone and the next generation of the planner software, including
            integration with an on-board single board computer running <a
            href="https://www.ros.org/">ROS</a>, the Robot Operating System on
            Linux.

          Through professional experience, personal projects, and my bachelor
          and master's theses, I have gained profound knowledge and the ability
          to practically apply deep learning and machine vision techniques for
          object detection, classification, and segmentation.

          Over my more than 7 years of focused software and systems development,
          I have mastered an extensive range of technologies and programming
          languages. Thanks to my computer science master's degree, I have a
          solid understanding of the fundamentals of the field, as well as of
          modern data science techniques.

          Through my undergraduate specialization in <a

          systems and networks</a> and professional experience, I also developed
          a deep understanding of application and network security.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>
          When I’m not programming I’m usually either hiking, climbing,
          geocaching or sailing. I also enjoy teaching others what I’ve learned.
          I’m a certified sailing coach and I tutor others in technological
          topics. Many of my projects are also inspired by my love for
          cartography and GIS. I’m a member of <a
          href="https://openstreetmap.be">OSM Belgium</a> and the <a
          href="https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Main_Page">OpenStreetMap
          Foundation</a>, and I’ve contributed several open-source apps and
          websites.
