Most of all, they have been a\ngreat way to learn with just the right amount of hackiness.\n\n## Door Handle Opener\n\nBecause an in-door smart lock was out of the question in our rented apartment,\nand of course for the fun of it, I built this door handle opener. It straps to\nthe door handle and can easily be removed without leaving a trace (just like the\n[space heater I smartified](#smartifying-an-old-space-heater)).\n\nCheck out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ubipo/door-handle-opener) for a \ndetailed write-up.\n\n<video width=\"320\" controls>\n  <source src=\"/content/projects/door-handle-opener-poc-demo.webm\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video>\n\n## Water Well Level Sensor\n\nMy dad and I needed a way to ensure the water level in a rain water collection\nwell doesn't drop too low and that a pump actually uses the water as scheduled.\nSo, as a fun end-to-end IoT project, I put together a sensor, serverless\nbackend, and web UI.\n\nCheck out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ubipo/water-well-level/) with all\nsource code, terraform scripts, and a detailed write-up.\n\n![Picture of the sensor in the well, showing the ESP module, battery, and\nultrasonic sensor](water-well-level-sensor.jpg \"Sensor in the well\")\n\n![Screenshot of the web UI showing the water level over time](water-well-level-webui.png \"Web UI showing the water level over time\")\n\n## Water Usage Monitoring\n\nThis project uses a small camera and WiFi microcontroller to read the digits on\nan analog water meter. Since I built this in 2018 (?) Belgium has started to \nroll out smart water meters, but at the time we still had an analog one without\neven a reed switch port. This project was a great reason to try out a bunch of\nthen new things for me: PCB design, training a neural net, and using a camera\nin an embedded electronics project.\n\nMy custom PCB, designed and ordered through [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/), was\nmounted above the water meter using a piece of wood. It supports an\n[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) WiFi\nmicrocontroller, and an [ArduCam](https://www.arducam.com/) camera module.\nPeriodically, the ESP8266 wakes up, lights a small LED, and takes a picture of\nthe meter display. As the ESP already struggles just to take the picture, the\nprocessing happens off-board on a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)\nserver running on my home server (back then the\n[ODROID-H2](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h2/)).\n\nFor each upload, the server first does a crude color-based bounds detection of\nthe two digits groups (black-on-white for whole liters, white-on-red for\nfractions) using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). Then, these two groups are then\neach split into individual digits, using the black separation lines. Finally,\neach digit is fed into a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) neural net. It is a\nsimple convolutional network designed for digit recognition, and trained using\nmy desktop's GPU on a dataset of just over 140 images I collected and manually\nlabeled. This tiny dataset was fine because of how consistent the digits are.\n\n![Picture of the Esp Water Meter PCB, showing circuitry and a small camera. The\nbottom-right of image also shows digits being recognized by the neural\nnet.](./ewam-with-recognition.webp \"PCB of the device and an example of\ndigits being recognized\")\n\n\n## Smartifying an Old Space Heater\n\nThis project had some great reverse-engineering fun. I used an off-the-shelf\n4-relay ESP module to control an old wall-mounted space heater in my dorm room.\nOne of the relays was wired in parallel with the heater's original switch, and\nwas controlled from a [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) server\nrunning on a Raspberry PI. That server also connected to a [bluetooth air\nquality/temperature sensor](https://aranet.com/products/aranet4/), effectively\nacting as a smart thermostat. I designed the case for the ESP module in [Fusion\n360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) and printed it at a\nlocal maker space.\n\n<video width=\"320\" controls>\n  <source src=\"/content/projects/space-heater-video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n</video> \n\n![Picture of the 3D-printed case for the ESP module mounted next to the\nheater](space-heater-box.jpg \"3D-printed case for the ESP module\nmounted next to the heater\")\n\n\n## Hacking + Smartifying a Garage Gate\n\nThis was an assignment for the *Security* module in the last year of my IT\nBachelor's. I used a [software defined\nradio](https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl2832u)\nto sniff the communication between a remote control and its garage gate. After\ndecoding the rolling code in the transmission using [Universal Radio\nHacker](https://github.com/jopohl/urh), I relayed it using a [generic 433MHz\ntransmitter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3071).\n\nIf miniaturized, this system could be installed near the gate and collect\nrolling codes whenever an authorized user opens the garage gate. This way, the\nattacker can open the gate at any later time. [The presentation\nslides](/content/projects/gate-RF-replay.pdf) contain diagrams to explain the\nattack.\n\n<video controls preload=\"metadata\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n  <source src=\"/content/projects/gate-rf-replay-demo.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\n  <track\n    label=\"English\"\n    kind=\"subtitles\"\n    srclang=\"en\"\n    src=\"/content/projects/gate-rf-replay-demo.vtt\"\n    default />\n</video>\n\nOf course I had no personal need for this attack because I already had a remote\nfor the gate. Being the lazy software developer I am however, it did get me\nthinking about how nice it would be to be able to open the gate from my phone.\nSo I soldered a relay to the remote control and hooked it up to the [Home\nAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) server in my dorm room.
