[Lakehopper](https://lakehopper.pfiers.net) is my vision for an autonomous drone
that can fly long distances by hopping from one lake to the next, recharging
its batteries each time using solar panels.


As my [Master’s thesis](/content/dissertation.pdf), I developed Lakehopper’s
high-level planning software. This system uses a convolutional neural network to
identify lakes and buildings from aerial imagery. From this, it generates a
navigation graph to calculate the best multi-hop paths between lakes. These
paths avoid build-up areas and restricted airspace. This software uses
[Python](/technologies/python) and [Tensorflow 2](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
to [create and train the
models](https://lakehopper.pfiers.net/vision/README.html). The planner component
that generates the navigation graph and calculates shortest paths is written in
[Rust](/technologies/rust) and also acts as the server for a
pure-[TypeScript](/technologies/typescript) web interface.


In my free time I’m working on the hardware of the drone. The [first
version](https://lakehopper.pfiers.net/design/1/README.html) I developed
unfortunately experienced a ~~crash~~ [rapid unscheduled
disassembly](https://lakehopper.pfiers.net/design/1/README.html#maiden-flight)
on its maiden flight. I’m currently working on the [second
version](https://lakehopper.pfiers.net/design/2/README.html).
