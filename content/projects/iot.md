I've created my fair share of IoT projects, mostly to solve small inconveniences
that don't *reaaaaly* need solving üòÖ. But hey, that's what IoT is for, and I
got the learn a ton along the way!


## Water usage monitoring

This project uses a small camera and WiFi microcontroller to read the digits on
an analog water meter. Since I built this in 2018 (?) Belgium has started to 
roll out smart water meters, but at the time we still had an analog one without
even a reed switch port. This project was a great reason to try out a bunch of
then new things for me: PCB design, training a neural net, and using a camera
in an embedded electronics project.

My custom PCB, designed and ordered through [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/), was
mounted above the water meter using a piece of wood. It supports an
[ESP8266](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp8266) WiFi
microcontroller, and an [ArduCam](https://www.arducam.com/) camera module.
Periodically, the ESP8266 wakes up, lights a small LED, and takes a picture of
the meter display. As the ESP already struggles just to take the picture, the
processing happens off-board on a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com)
server running on my home server (back then the
[ODROID-H2](https://www.hardkernel.com/shop/odroid-h2/)).

For each upload, the server first does a crude color-based bounds detection of
the two digits groups (black-on-white for whole liters, white-on-red for
fractions) using [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). Then, these two groups are then
each split into individual digits, using the black separation lines. Finally,
each digit is fed into a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) neural net. It is a
simple convolutional network designed for digit recognition, and trained using
my desktop's GPU on a dataset of just over 140 images I collected and manually
labeled. This tiny dataset was fine because of how consistent the digits are.

## Smartifying an old space heater

This one was a lot of fun. I used an off-the-shelf 4-relay ESP module to control
an old wall-mounted space heater in my dorm room. One of the relays was wired in
parallel with the heater's original switch, and was controlled from a
[HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) server running on a Raspberry
PI. That server also connected to a [bluetooth air quality/temperature
sensor](https://aranet.com/products/aranet4/), effectively acting as a smart
thermostat. I designed the case for the ESP module in [Fusion
360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview) and printed it at a
local maker space.

## Hacking + smartifying a garage gate

This was an assignment for the *Security* module in the last year of my
Bachelor's. I used a [software defined
radio](https://www.realtek.com/en/products/communications-network-ics/item/rtl2832u)
to sniff the communication between a remote control and its garage gate. After
decoding the rolling code in the transmission using [Universal Radio
Hacker](https://github.com/jopohl/urh), I was able to replay it using a [generic
433MHz transmitter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3071).

If miniaturized, this system could be installed near the gate and collect
rolling codes whenever an authorized user opens the garage gate. This way, the
attacker can open the gate at any later time. [The presentation
slides](/content/projects/gate-RF-replay.pdf) contain diagrams to explain the
attack.

Of course I had no personal need for this attack because I already had a remote
for the gate. Being the lazy software developer I am however, it did get me
thinking about how nice it would be to be able to open the gate from my phone.
So I soldered a relay to the remote control and hooked it up to the
HomeAssistant server in my dorm room. Infinite range achieved ‚ôæÔ∏è!

## Dimming lamps and controlling LED strips

Besides all of the above, I've also used IoT to dim lamps, control LED strips
and hook into light switches. All those mini projects are some combination of
taking a cheap ESP module, connecting it to a relay or breakout board and
hooking it up to HomeAssistant. Below for example is a video of me controlling a
dimmer circuit that I connected to an Ikea lamp.

When it comes to the firmware on the ESP modules, I've used pre-built HTTP
libraries, written my own HTTP server, used MQTT, written a custom UDP protocol,
and eventually settled on just using [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/) or
[Tasmota](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/) for most projects.
