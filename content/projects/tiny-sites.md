These are the odds and ends of my web development work. They are static or
client-side-only websites for experiments or assignments.

## OSM Contact Info Corrector

A simple webapp to update contact information on OpenStreetMap. You can [view it
live](https://opf.osm.be) or [browse its code on
GitHub](https://github.com/ubipo/opf). It was built without
[TypeScript](/technologies/typescript) or a frontend framework, just plain old
[JS](/technologies/javascript). This app's functionality has been superseded by
a specific theme in [MapComplete](https://pietervdvn.github.io/MapComplete/),
the successor to [Cyclofix](/projects/cyclofix).

  selected one.](osm-contact-info-corrector.webp "OSM Contact Info
  Corrector webapp")


## Trend-Friends

A small assignment for the *Web Development* module in the second year of my
bachelorâ€™s degree, focused on accessibility and responsive design. While it's no
longer online (it was hosted on the university's servers), you can still check
out the code in its [git repository](https://github.com/ubipo/trend-friends).

## Karels Cryptonator 9000

Truly [the tinyist of tiny sites](https://karels-crypto.pfiers.net/). It's
simply a text input that allows you to search through the Dutch dictionary using
a RegEx. The name is a reference to a popular word puzzle in the Belgium
newspaper [*De Standaard*](https://standaard.be/). The most notable thing about
this site is that it's probably one of my most used projects, receiving over
2000 clicks and a million impressions per month on Google.
